General\nThis policy has been put in place to establish a mechanism for identifying, ranking, and patching security vulnerabilities across the {{company_name}} platform.\n\n2. Goal\nThe purpose of this policy is to provide a framework for vulnerability identification, threat assessment, priority ranking, and voluntary or involuntary remediation via patch distribution by manual or automated methods.\n\n3. Definition\n{{definition_content}}\n\n4. Responsibility\n{{responsible_role_title}}. \n\n5. Operation method\n\n5.1. Vulnerability scans\nRoutine scans should be conducted on devices, systems, and applications connected to {{company_name}}'s networks and cloud environments to identify vulnerabilities in operating systems and applications. Information system owners within {{company_name}} are required to review scan results, assess risk levels, and take corrective actions where necessary. Scans and reviews should be performed at least {{scan_frequency}} as part of the organizational risk assessment or whenever changes are made that may introduce new vulnerabilities. Findings should be addressed according to the assessed level of risk.\n\n5.2. Patch handling\n\nPatching Priorities\nPatching priorities should be determined based on risk assessment. Patches with high or critical risk levels should be applied as soon as possible, while patches with low risk levels should be applied as part of the regular system maintenance schedule.\n\nResponsibilities\nThe {{security_team_name}} in {{company_name}} will review each new alert regarding security vulnerabilities, assess the risk, and recommend a schedule for patch installation based on the threat severity. This team will continue to monitor the status of alerts and apply patches manually or automatically as needed.\n\nEnforcement Criteria\nEnforcement should be conducted according to the urgency level of the patch. Enforcement criteria may include:\n• Automated application of the patch or operational change to the system.\n• Temporary disconnection of the system from the network until the patch is applied.\n• Deactivation of the system or removal from the cloud environment, if necessary.\n\n6.
